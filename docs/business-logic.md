# 🧠 Business Logic — Deep Dive

This document describes how the game logic actually works, based on a full source
audit (v1.5.4). It covers the synchronization model, the lobby lifecycle, and the
state machine of every game.

## Core synchronization model

The platform is **client-authoritative**: there is no game server. All game state
lives in one JSONB column (`lobbies.game_state`) in Supabase Postgres, and every
mutation is performed by a client:

```
Player action → clone state (JSON.parse/stringify) → mutate → version++ →
setGameState (optimistic local) → UPDATE lobbies SET game_state → 
Supabase Realtime (postgres_changes) → all other clients receive new state
```

Key elements, identical in all five game hooks:

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `version` (number) | Monotonic counter. Incoming realtime states with `version < local` are dropped (protects against out-of-order delivery). |
| `lastActionTime` | Timestamp of the last mutation; some UIs derive timers from it. |
| `turnDeadline` | Absolute epoch-ms deadline for the current turn (Coup, Battleship) so timers agree across clients. |
| `stateRef` (React ref) | Every hook mirrors its state into a ref so async callbacks always read the freshest state. |
| Latency hiding | Flager and Minesweeper merge the local player's own sub-state over incoming server state when the local copy is "ahead" (more guesses / more opened cells). |

**Write path (v2.0):** all state writes go through
[`src/lib/gameStateSync.ts`](../src/lib/gameStateSync.ts) → the `update_game_state`
RPC, which performs a **compare-and-swap** (`WHERE version = expected`). On a
version conflict the losing client re-fetches and re-syncs instead of silently
overwriting the other write. If the SQL migration hasn't been applied yet, the
helper transparently falls back to the legacy last-write-wins `UPDATE`.

## Lobby lifecycle

1. **Create** (`/create`): the host picks a game and settings; the client inserts a
   row into `lobbies` with a random 6-char `code`, `is_private` + `password`
   (optional), and a pre-seeded `game_state` (host is player #1).
2. **Discover** (`/play`): all non-finished lobbies are listed with realtime
   refresh; join by code is also supported. Private lobbies require the password.
3. **Join**: for Coup the joiner is added to `game_state.players` directly from
   `/play`; all other games auto-join via `initGame()` inside the game page
   (effect: "if I'm not in players and status === waiting → add me").
4. **Waiting room** (`UniversalLobby`): shows presence (Supabase Presence channel
   `presence:<code>`), host can kick, offline players are auto-kicked by the host
   after a 10-second grace period. Start button unlocks at `minPlayers`.
5. **Playing**: game-specific (below).
6. **Finish/Leave**: when the last player leaves, the client deletes the lobby row.
   Host leaving transfers `isHost` to the first remaining player.

### Presence & auto-kick

`usePresenceHeartbeat(roomCode, userId)` tracks a Supabase Presence channel keyed
by user id. In `UniversalLobby`, **only the host** runs a 1-second interval: any
player missing from presence gets a 10s countdown; if still offline they are
removed from `game_state.players` (fetch-fresh → filter → update).

## Per-game state machines

### 🎭 Coup (`useCoupGame`)
The most complex machine. `players` is an **array**; `turnIndex` points at the
current player.

Phases:
```
choosing_action
   ├─ income ──────────────────────────────► nextTurn
   ├─ coup (-7) ─────────────► losing_influence(target) ─► nextTurn
   ├─ foreign_aid ──────────► waiting_for_blocks
   └─ tax / steal / exchange / assassinate ─► waiting_for_challenges
waiting_for_challenges ─(all pass)─► apply effect      (tax/exchange)
                        └─(steal/assassinate)─► waiting_for_blocks
waiting_for_blocks ─(block)─► waiting_for_block_challenges
                   └─(all pass)─► apply effect
waiting_for_block_challenges ─(pass)─► action cancelled ─► nextTurn
                             └─(challenge)─► losing_influence(...)
losing_influence ─(card picked)─► resolves action.nextPhase
resolving_exchange ─(cards picked)─► nextTurn
```

- **Challenge resolution**: if the accused proves the role, the shown card is
  shuffled into the deck and replaced, and the challenger loses influence; the
  original action continues (`nextPhase: 'continue_action'`). If the accused
  bluffed, they lose influence and the action is cancelled/continues per context.
- **Deck**: 15 cards (3 of each of 5 roles), 2 dealt per player.
- **AFK protection**: 60s turn / 30s reaction deadlines; on expiry `skipTurn()`
  removes the offending player (choose/lose/exchange phases) or force-resolves the
  reaction phase. Any client whose local timer hits 0 may fire it.
- **Win**: last player with an unrevealed card; also triggered when others leave.
- **Stats**: on `finished`, each client records win/loss for itself
  (`durationSeconds` is a hardcoded 900).

### ⚓ Battleship (`useBattleshipGame`)
`players` is a **Record<userId, PlayerBoard>** (exactly 2). Phases:
`setup → playing → finished`; lobby `status` mirrors `waiting → playing → finished`.

- **Placement**: ships are kept **locally** (`myShips`) during setup and only
  written to the DB on "Ready" (`submitShips`). Placement validation: 10×10 board,
  no touching (1-cell danger zone), fleet = 1×4, 2×3, 3×2, 4×1. Auto-placement
  retries up to 200 board attempts.
- **Both ready → playing**: first player in the object gets the first turn, 60s
  `turnDeadline`.
- **Shots**: hit → shoot again; miss → turn passes. A killed ship auto-marks its
  1-cell perimeter as misses. Win when `aliveShipsCount === 0`.
- **Timeout**: the *current* player's own client passes the turn on expiry.
- **Leaving mid-match** = surrender: remaining player wins.

### 🚩 Flager (`useFlagerGame`)
`players` is an **array**. Statuses: `waiting → playing ⇄ round_end → finished`.

- **Start**: host generates `targetChain` — N random country codes (out of ~246);
  every round has a 3-second countdown (`roundStartTime = now + 3000`).
- **Guessing**: up to 10 attempts per round. The flag is revealed via canvas
  pixel-matching: every guessed flag's pixels within RGB distance <45 of the
  target's pixels become permanently visible ("Pixel Match").
- **Scoring**: `points = max(10, 1000 − (attempts−1)×50 − seconds×10)`.
- **Round end**: when every player `hasFinishedRound` (guessed, out of attempts,
  or personal timeout), results are appended to `history`, status → `round_end`;
  next round starts when **all** players press "Next".
- **Finish**: after the last round; the podium ranks by total score.
- **Stats**: recorded flat (no single/multi mode split and no `extraCount` in this
  version — see TODO).

### 💣 Minesweeper (`useMinesweeperGame`)
`players` is a **Record<userId, MinesweeperPlayer>`; each player has their **own
board** with the same settings (versus race). Statuses: `waiting → playing → finished`.

- **Board generation**: empty boards on start; mines are placed on the player's
  *first click* with a 3×3 safe zone (first-click safety).
- **Opening**: iterative flood-fill (stack-based, no recursion). Chording (middle
  click on a number with matching flags) opens remaining neighbors.
- **Win**: open all safe cells **or** flag exactly all mines. First winner ends
  the match for everyone (`status = finished`, `winner = name`).
- **Loss**: mine hit or personal timeout → player status `lost`; match ends when
  no one is left playing.
- **Leaving** mid-game marks the player `left` (board stays visible, grayed).
- **Stats**: win/loss with `mode` (single vs multi by player count) and
  `extraCount` = correctly flagged mines.

### 🕵️ Spyfall (`useSpyfallGame`)
`players` is an **array**. Statuses: `waiting → playing ⇄ voting → finished`.

- **Start**: one random location from the selected pack; one random spy
  (`spyCount` is fixed at 1); civilians get roles from the location's role list
  (roles repeat if players > roles). Roles are stored as JSON-stringified
  `{ru, en}` names.
- **Nomination**: any player may accuse once per round (`hasNominated`); the game
  switches to `voting`, author auto-votes "yes".
- **Voting**: everyone except the target votes; conviction requires **unanimous**
  yes. Spy convicted → locals win (`spy_caught`); innocent convicted → spy wins
  (`innocent_killed`). Any "no" returns to playing.
- **Spy guess**: the spy may at any time name the location — correct → spy wins
  (`guessed_loc`), wrong → locals win (`spy_failed_guess`).
- **Timer**: round duration (3–15 min); on expiry the spy wins (`time`). Note:
  the timer keeps running during voting.
- **Leaving**: spy leaving → locals win (`spy_left`); a civilian leaving below 3
  players → technical spy win.
- **Scoring across rounds** (persists via "New Round"): spy win +5 to spy;
  locals win +1 to each civilian, +1 bonus to a successful nomination author.
- **Stats**: ⚠️ not recorded at all in this version (see TODO).

## Statistics (`lib/playerStats.ts`)

`updatePlayerStats(userId, {gameType, result, durationSeconds, mode?, extraCount?})`:

- Reads `player_stats` by `user_id` (a row must already exist — created by a
  DB-side signup trigger; guests without a row are skipped).
- For **minesweeper/flager with `mode`**: keeps `details[game].single|multi`
  buckets `{wins, lost, time, extra}` and migrates the legacy flat format on the fly.
- Otherwise: flat `details[game] = {wins, lost, time}`.
- `time` is stored in minutes (min 1 per game); `total_games` increments.
- The achievements page aggregates single+multi and tolerates both formats.

## Authentication flows (`AuthForm`, `Settings`, `reset-password`)

- **Sign up**: username uniqueness check against `profiles`, then
  `auth.signUp` with `{username, avatar_url}` metadata (random DiceBear avatar);
  email confirmation redirect → current origin.
- **Sign in**: the single input accepts username *or* email; usernames are
  resolved to email via `profiles`.
- **Guest**: `signInAnonymously` + random avatar; progress not persisted.
- **Google OAuth**: standard redirect flow.
- **Password reset**: only from Settings (logged-in) via `resetPasswordForEmail`
  → `/reset-password`. There is no "forgot password" link on the login form (TODO).
- Route guards: every protected page redirects unauthenticated users to
  `/?returnUrl=<path>`; `AuthForm` honors `returnUrl` after login.
