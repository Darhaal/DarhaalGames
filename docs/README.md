# 📚 Darhaal Games — Documentation

Documentation for **Darhaal Games** — five browser games for playing with
friends, at https://games.okhten.com.

Written to be read by someone deciding whether the engineering here is any good,
so it tries to be accurate about what works, what is deliberately unfinished,
and why. [Security](security.md) is the most honest of these documents and
probably the most interesting.
