# Backlog

State after **v2.1.0**. This is the real list, including the things that are
open on purpose — see [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) for the reasoning
behind the accepted risks.

## Open

### Worth doing next

- **Server-side move validation.** The client computes `game_state` and writes
  it; the database checks the version, not the legality of the move, so a
  crafted client can cheat. Accepted while the platform is played among friends
  — the first thing to build if it ever opens to strangers or gains a
  leaderboard. See finding 7 in the security analysis.
- **Extend tests to the state machines.** Coverage is good on pure game logic
  and on the SEO layer, but Coup phase transitions and Flager rounds are only
  exercised by playing. Needs either a Supabase mock or further extraction of
  pure reducers.
- **E2E smoke for multiplayer.** Two browser contexts, one match, assert both
  see the same state. Playwright would do it; nothing exists yet.
- **The retry path has no unit test.** Conflict-and-retry was verified against
  the live database (twelve simultaneous writes, none lost) but not in CI —
  `useLobbySync` is a hook and needs a renderer or a mocked client.

### Smaller

- **Coup edge case.** Challenge/block chains where a player with a pending card
  loss leaves mid-resolution. Guards are in place; wants live verification with
  real players rather than reasoning.
- **Spyfall custom locations.** The settings already exist in state; there is no
  UI for them.
- **Profile enumeration.** `profiles` is readable by anyone, so usernames can be
  harvested. Needed by the sign-up "name taken" check; would require moving that
  check behind an RPC.
- **`lobbies.host_id` has no delete cascade,** deliberately — cascading it would
  destroy rooms other people are still playing in. The trade-off is that an
  account hosting a lobby cannot be deleted until that lobby is gone.

### Held back by upstream

- **ESLint 10.** `eslint-plugin-react`, pulled in by `eslint-config-next`, still
  calls `context.getFilename()`, removed in 10 — linting crashes outright.
- **TypeScript 7.** `typescript-eslint` refuses TS 7.0 by design; support is
  tracked for >= 7.1. Worth revisiting, since `tsc`, the tests and the build all
  pass under it already.

## Done

Kept short — the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) has the full history.

**Security (2.1.0).** `TRUNCATE` revoked from client roles; room passwords and
user emails hidden at column level; lobby writes narrowed to a compare-and-swap
RPC with `leave_lobby` for deletion; four tables belonging to an unrelated
project closed off; `search_path` pinned on every `SECURITY DEFINER` function.
All re-tested from outside with [`scripts/authz-test.mjs`](scripts/authz-test.mjs).

**Reliability (2.1.0).** Simultaneous actions no longer cost a player their
move. Finished matches keep their results when someone leaves. Stale lobbies are
collected daily by a `pg_cron` job instead of accumulating forever.

**Reach (2.1.0).** Public server-rendered pages with hreflang, structured data
and Open Graph cards; the domain root serves content instead of an empty shell.

**Onboarding (2.1.0).** Every new account gets an avatar; first run offers a
nickname.

**Earlier (2.0).** Shared sync core extracted from all five game hooks
(−350 lines); zero `any` and zero lint warnings; honest statistics in every
game; sound, toasts and keyboard controls; join-by-link; password recovery.

## Shelved

- **Geo Defense** — a tower-defence prototype that never fit the platform's
  "share a link, play for ten minutes" shape. Not ported.
- **Mafia** — the placeholder was removed in 2.1.0 rather than left as a
  permanent "coming soon". Worth building properly or not at all.
