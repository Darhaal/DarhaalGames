# Changelog

All notable changes to Darhaal Games. The in-app changelog (RU/EN) lives in
[`src/constants/version.ts`](src/constants/version.ts) — keep both in sync when
releasing.

Format: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Types: **major** = platform
milestone, **minor** = new game mode / feature, **patch** = fixes & improvements.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-09-02 (minor) — **Spyfall Expanded**

### Added
- **Spyfall content**: 15 packs of 22 locations with 20 roles each — 330
  locations and 6600 roles, up from 30 and 150. New packs: Nature, History,
  Sci-Fi, Sports, Food.
- **Location artwork**, generated per card rather than downloaded: a
  deterministic colour field seeded by the location id plus a thematic icon.
  No requests, no hosting bandwidth, identical for every player.

### Fixed
- Location images had been returning **404 since the packs were written** —
  `public/spyfall/` was never populated. The UI hid the broken image behind a
  gradient, so it degraded quietly instead of visibly.
- **Avatars no longer call a third party.** The previous URL sent the Supabase
  user id to `api.dicebear.com` on every render; the same artwork is now
  produced by the app itself and cached immutably.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-08-20 (minor) — **New Home**

> The platform moves to its own domain and gains a public, crawlable surface.

### Added
- **New domain**: the platform now lives at `games.okhten.com`; the previous
  deployment URL redirects to it.
- **Public game pages** with descriptions, rules and screenshots — reachable
  without signing in, so a game can be shared as a plain link.
- Search-engine groundwork: per-page titles and descriptions, social preview
  cards, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` and a web app manifest.

### Changed
- **Modular UI architecture**: shared layout, header and localization extracted
  into reusable modules instead of being repeated per page.
- Faster first load — less JavaScript shipped for pages that do not need it.
- Refreshed navigation between the lobby, game and statistics screens.

## [2.0.4] — 2026-08-05 (patch)
- Stability on weak connections: rejoin your room without losing your seat, with
  clear notifications when the connection drops.

## [2.0.3] — 2026-07-27 (patch)
- Mobile: larger tap targets, fixed layout on narrow screens, and refined
  gestures in Minesweeper and Battleship.

## [2.0.2] — 2026-07-18 (patch)
- Faster room list and statistics page, with reduced traffic during match
  synchronization.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-07-11 (patch) — Polish
- The avatar-delete **native `confirm()` replaced with an in-app confirmation
  dialog** (Escape / backdrop to cancel) — the last native dialog is gone.
- **Zero-warning codebase**: remaining ESLint warnings resolved (unused
  imports/vars removed; intentional `exhaustive-deps` effects documented).
- Removed dead code and unused props.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-07-09 (major) — 🚀 **Platform 2.0**

> A full-codebase audit plus a round of hardening and polish. Consolidates the
> initial 2.0.0 launch and its same-day follow-ups (branding, keyboard UX, input
> fixes, controls & rules audit) into one release.

### Security
- Room passwords **never leave the database**: server-side verification via the
  `join_lobby_check` RPC; the lobby list no longer selects the `password` column.
- **Optimistic locking** for every game-state write (CAS RPC `update_game_state`)
  with automatic client re-sync on version conflicts.
- Username → email sign-in resolution behind the `get_login_email` RPC; RLS
  enabled on `profiles`; owner-only statistics reads; schema repair
  (`profiles.username`, signup trigger, user backfill).
- Credentials strictly from environment variables; 8 dependency vulnerabilities
  fixed; Next.js 16.2.10. All config centralized in `src/constants/app.ts`.

### Games & UX
- **Honest statistics in every game** (Spyfall recorded for the first time;
  Flager solo/multi parity; real match durations for Coup/Battleship).
- **Join-by-link for Coup**, a "game already in progress" screen for late
  visitors, **forgot-password** flow.
- **Keyboard controls**: Escape closes dismissible dialogs, Enter submits the
  private-room password, arrow keys navigate the Flager suggestions, Battleship
  rotate keys; dialogs also close on backdrop click.
- **Minesweeper chord** on a left-click/tap of a number (open remaining
  neighbors when the flag count matches) + keyboard zoom.
- **Sound**: synthesized WebAudio cues wired to the volume setting.
  **Toasts** replace every native `alert()`.
- **Branding**: platform *Darhaal Games*, a product of **Okhten Group LLC**
  (LICENSE, footers, README). Settings reachable from every page; the panel
  renders through a portal so it is never clipped by blurred headers.

### Engineering
- **Zero ESLint errors** (from 82): all `any` eliminated, `useLang` via
  `useSyncExternalStore`, nested render components hoisted.
- **Shared sync core** `hooks/core/useLobbySync` deduplicated out of all five
  game hooks (−350 lines). Pure game logic extracted to `src/lib/gameLogic/`.
- **Unit tests** (vitest) for placement/fleet, mines/flood-fill/chord,
  deck/roles, scoring. CI: build + blocking lint + tests. `next/image` everywhere.
- Full documentation set (`docs/`), SQL migrations.

### Fixed (highlights)
- Sign-in by email; Battleship waiting-lobby leave counted as a win; Minesweeper
  losses not recorded / all-lost game never finishing; Minesweeper cell clicks
  swallowed by pointer capture; Coup turn-order corruption on leave; multi-client
  timer races; Spyfall vote-timer overlap; room-code generation & collisions;
  the dead background-texture CDN; the settings panel clipped on secondary pages.
