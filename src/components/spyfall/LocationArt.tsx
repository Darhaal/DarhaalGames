/**
 * Artwork for a location card, generated rather than downloaded.
 *
 * `public/spyfall/` never existed, so every location image path had been
 * returning 404 since the packs were written — the UI hid the broken image and
 * fell back to a flat grey gradient, which is why it went unnoticed. Rather
 * than sourcing and hosting 330 photographs, each card draws its own: a
 * deterministic `boring-avatars` field seeded by the location id, plus a
 * thematic lucide icon.
 *
 * Nothing is fetched. Both libraries render inline SVG from the bundle, so a
 * card costs zero requests and zero hosting bandwidth, works offline, and is
 * stable — a location always looks the same to everyone.
 *
 * It reads as artwork rather than a placeholder because the card already
 * covers this layer with a scrim and centres the location name over it: at
 * 200×125 a photograph would be texture anyway. The icon sits low and faint
 * so it never competes with that label.
